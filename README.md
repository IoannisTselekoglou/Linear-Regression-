## Introduction

This is a Python project that implements the Linear Regression algorithms from scratch. The purpose of this project is to provide a clear and understandable implementation of these fundamental machine learning algorithms, suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for further research.

## Explanation

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous target values based on input features. It aims to find the best-fit straight line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values.


## Examples

To demonstrate the usage of the implemented algorithms, we provide the following examples:

- [example1.py](examples/example1.py): Example of Linear Regression applied to a synthetic dataset.

Feel free to explore and run these examples to understand how the algorithms work in different scenarios.

## Testing

Unit tests are essential to ensure the correctness of our implementations. We have included comprehensive test suites for both the Linear Regression and Gradient Descent algorithms.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
$ python -m unittest discover tests
