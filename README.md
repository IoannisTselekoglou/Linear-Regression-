## Introduction

This Python project implements Linear Regression algorithms from scratch. The primary goal is to have an comprehensible implementation of these fundamental machine learning algorithms 

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm designed for predicting continuous target values based on input features. Its objective is to identify the best-fit straight line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between predicted and actual values.

## Examples

To illustrate the usage of the implemented algorithms, we provide the following examples:

- [linear.py](examples/example1.py): Demonstrates Linear Regression applied to a random dataset.


## Conclusion 

When Visulaizing the Graphs, we can see the distance between the acutall Datapoints and the linear lines.
Comparing the MSE Values, we can see that the algoritihgm for calculating the best ift, is signifantly better than for example the random Line.
Mean Squared Error (Best Fit): 22.6364
Mean Squared Error (Random Line): 121.6121


## Dependencies
